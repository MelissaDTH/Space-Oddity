# :rocket: :space_invader: Space Travel app :rocket: :space_invader:

This application is created by me for Codaisseur Academy. In week 10, there was a Hackathon that lasted 3 days with the theme: 'travel'. I had to create an app with a technology that the Academy did not teach us. I decided to use Vue.js and other libraries, the new technologies I used were:

- Vue.js (framework);
- Vuex (state management);
- Vuetify (styling);
- Vue router;
- Axios (promise-based HTTP client);
- Core.js;
- Debug;
- Pug.

## Application features

The app can do the following:

- It has a fully working **navigation bar** and **footer**;
- At the homepage, you get information about some planets and our solar system;
- Clicking on those planents, it will **redirect** you to the /planets route;
- At the Planets page you can get more information, of which the sections "Astronomy Photo of the Day" and "Mars Rover photos" show data and images from **two different NASA API's** that are open to the public;
- There is a login page, but this is not fully working because in this project, I have not worked with a back-end;
- The **Space Game (found in the navigationbar)**, has a welcome page with a button where you can start the game;
- At the page of the game, you press the key **'space' to start the game** and get as many points as you can with playing the **retro game 'snake'**;
- You can pause the game with the 'space' key and you can exit the game by pressing the X button on the screen;
