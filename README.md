# :rocket: :space_invader: Space Travel app :rocket: :space_invader:

This application is created by me for Codaisseur Academy. In week 10, there was a Hackathon that lasted four days with the theme: 'travel'. I had to create an app with a technology that the Academy did not teach us. I decided to use Vue.js and other libraries, the new technologies I used were:

  -  Vue.js (framework);
  -  Vuex (state management);
  -  Vuetify (styling);
  -  Vue router;
  -  Axios (promise-based HTTP client);
  -  Font Awesome;
  -  Core.js;
  -  Debug;
  -  Pug.
  

## Application features

The app can do the following:

  - It has a fully working navigation bar and footer;
  - At the homepage, you get information about some plants and our solar system;
  - Clicking on those planents, it wel redirect you to the /planets page;
  - At the Planets page you can get more information, of which the sections "Astronomy Photo of the Day" and "Mars Rover photos" show data and images from two different NASA API's that are open to the public;
  - There is a login page, but this is at the moment just for show;
  - The Space Game (found in the navigation), has a welcome page with a button where you can actually start the game;
  - At the page of the game, you press the key 'space' to start the game and get as many points as you can with playing the retro game 'snake';
