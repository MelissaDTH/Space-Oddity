          The planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky
          Way galaxy. Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and
          everything bound to it by gravity â€” the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth,
          Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as
          Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and
          meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands
          of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading mt-3">
          There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current count
          orbiting our star: eight. The inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus,
          Earth and Mars. The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn
          and ice giants Uranus and Neptune. Beyond Neptune, a newer class of
          smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including perennial
          favorite Pluto.

          100 Billion alien planets fill our Milky Way Galaxy
        </div>
        <p class="subheading mt-3">
          Our Milky Way galaxy is home to at least 100 billion alien planets,
          and possibly many more, a new study suggests. "It's a staggering
          number, if you think about it," lead author Jonathan Swift, of Caltech
          in Pasadena, said in a statement. "Basically there's one of these
          planets per star." Swift and his colleagues arrived at their estimate
          after studying a five-planet system called Kepler-32, which lies about
          915 light-years from Earth. The five worlds were detected by NASA's
          Kepler Space Telescope, which flags the tiny brightness dips caused
          when exoplanets cross their star's face from the instrument's
          perspective.
