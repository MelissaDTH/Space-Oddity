        <p class="subheading mt-3">
          The planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky
          Way galaxy. Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and
          everything bound to it by gravity â€” the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth,
          Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as
          Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and
          meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands
          of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading mt-3">
          There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current count
          orbiting our star: eight. The inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus,
          Earth and Mars. The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn
          and ice giants Uranus and Neptune. Beyond Neptune, a newer class of
          smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including perennial
          favorite Pluto.

        <div class="headline mt-3">Terrestrial Planets</div>
        <p class="subheading mt-3">
          The terrestrial planets are the four innermost planets in the solar
          system, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. They are called terrestrial
          because they have a compact, rocky surface like the Earth's. The
          planets, Venus, Earth, and Mars have significant atmospheres while
          Mercury has almost none. The following diagram shows the approximate
          distance of the terrestrial planets to the Sun.
